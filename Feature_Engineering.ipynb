        "It transforms features so they have a similar scale, typically by rescaling to a fixed range (like 0 to 1) or adjusting to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.\n",

        "Why is feature scaling important?\n",
        "Many ML algorithms (like gradient descent, SVM, KNN, and neural networks) perform better or converge faster when features are on similar scales.\n",

        "Prevents features with large values from dominating those with smaller values.\n",

        "Helps algorithms that calculate distances (e.g., KNN, clustering) to treat all features equally.\n",
